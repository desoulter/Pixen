	<p>Pixen makes creating animations easy. Simply select <strong>New Animation</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu to get started (you can also import sequences of images and animated GIFs). The document window is split into two sections: a filmstrip on top and the canvas below.</p>
	<p>The filmstrip contains your animation's frames. Create, delete, and reorder frames at will. Change the duration of a frame by double-clicking the timestamp beneath it. To start editing a frame in the canvas, simply click it.</p>
	<p>To preview your animation, open the <strong>Preview</strong> window. Once you're happy with the result, animations can be saved as animated GIFs, QuickTime movies, image sequences, and even sprite sheets!</p>
