	<p>Pixen's color palettes are key to the creation of low- and high-color pixel art alike. They make it easy to create and manage predefined schemes of colors that can be reused across documents.</p>
	<p>To get started, open the Colors panel by clicking on the color well in the Tools palette. Switch to the <strong>Pixen Colors</strong> tab (on the far right).</p>
	<p>Here, you can create and organize palettes of common colors, import palettes of various formats, and even detach palettes into their own panels. To make a color active, simply click it. To change a color, drag a replacement color on top of it.</p>
	<p>Document windows also contain a color frequency palette. When you modify its colors, the image changes accordingly.</p>
